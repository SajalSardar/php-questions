4. Create a Factorial Programing in PHP recursive function;
5. Check whether a number is prime or not with function();



Problem Solving using PHP loops:
1. Create a script using a for loop to add all the integers between 0 and 30 and display the total.

2. Write a program which will give you all of the potential combinations of a two-digit decimal combination,
 printed in a comma delimited format

Sample output :
00, 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

3. Write a PHP Script to sum of even numbers from 1 to 10
4. Write a PHP Script to sum of odd numbers from 1 to 10

1. Create a pyramid using (*) with for loop.
2. Create a script that can print 1-100 time table.
3. Create a Chest Board With php loop
4. Create A program that an identify all even or odds number from 1-100.
5. Create a factorial program using php loop.
6. Using while loop print 1 to 10
Output:
1#2#3#4#5#6#7#8#9#10#
7. Using for loop print only even number from 1-10
Output:
